This repository contains the following projects:

1) amiq_hello_world : This example will print "Hello world" from System Verilog - Octave interconnection

2) amiq_dsp_algorithms : In this project System Verilog is connected with Octave and it contains the implementation of 4 DSP functions (Fast Fourier Function, Discrete Cosine Transform, Finite Impulse Response and Convolution) in System Verilog and Octave

3) amiq_dsp_algorithms_fp : In this project System Verilog is connected with SystemC and it contains the implementation of 4 DSP functions (Fast Fourier Function, Discrete Cosine Transform, Finite Impulse Response and Convolution) in System Verilog and SystemC
